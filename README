Cracking-the-n-Back-Code

RPI Cognitive Science Project

===================

This is an RPI Cognitive Science project with the idea
to help strengthen the working memory of recovering 
alcoholics.

The game: 
The player needs to memorize each dot 
pattern leading up to a question. There are no penalties 
for wrong answers and the game gets progressively 
harder only with every few correct responses.

Contains some bugs due to rushing.
